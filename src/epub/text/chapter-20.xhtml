      XX. “TRUEMAN! TRUEMAN! TRUEMAN!”
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    “Often do the spirits
    Of great events stride on before the events,
    And in to-day already walks to-morrow.”
         Coleridge.
</pre>
<p>
      INSTANTLY a great dread seized me. What revelations might not this man be
      going to make! But I subdued the feeling; and, greeting him with what
      cordiality I could, settled myself to listen to his explanations.
    </p>
<p>
      But Trueman Harwell had no explanations to give, or so it seemed; on the
      contrary, he had come to apologize for the very violent words he had used
      the evening before; words which, whatever their effect upon me, he now
      felt bound to declare had been used without sufficient basis in fact to
      make their utterance of the least importance.
    </p>
<p>
      “But you must have thought you had grounds for so tremendous an
      accusation, or your act was that of a madman.”
     </p>
<p>
      His brow wrinkled heavily, and his eyes assumed a very gloomy expression.
      “It does not follow,” he returned. “Under the pressure of surprise, I have
      known men utter convictions no better founded than mine without running
      the risk of being called mad.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Surprise? Mr. Clavering’s face or form must, then, have been known to
      you. The mere fact of seeing a strange gentleman in the hall would have
      been insufficient to cause you astonishment, Mr. Harwell.”
     </p>
<p>
      He uneasily fingered the back of the chair before which he stood, but made
      no reply.
    </p>
<p>
      “Sit down,” I again urged, this time with a touch of command in my voice.
      “This is a serious matter, and I intend to deal with it as it deserves.
      You once said that if you knew anything which might serve to exonerate
      Eleanore Leavenworth from the suspicion under which she stands, you would
      be ready to impart it.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pardon me. I said that if I had ever known anything calculated to release
      her from her unhappy position, I would have spoken,” he coldly corrected.
    </p>
<p>
      “Do not quibble. You know, and I know, that you are keeping something
      back; and I ask you, in her behalf, and in the cause of justice, to tell
      me what it is.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You are mistaken,” was his dogged reply. “I have reasons, perhaps, for
      certain conclusions I may have drawn; but my conscience will not allow me
      in cold blood to give utterance to suspicions which may not only damage
      the reputation of an honest man, but place me in the unpleasant position
      of an accuser without substantial foundation for my accusations.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You occupy that position already,” I retorted, with equal coldness.
      “Nothing can make me forget that in my presence you have denounced Henry
      Clavering as the murderer of Mr. Leavenworth. You had better explain
      yourself, Mr. Harwell.”
     </p>
<p>
      He gave me a short look, but moved around and took the chair. “You have me
      at a disadvantage,” he said, in a lighter tone. “If you choose to profit
      by your position, and press me to disclose the little I know, I can only
      regret the necessity under which I lie, and speak.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then you are deterred by conscientious scruples alone?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, and by the meagreness of the facts at my command.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I will judge of the facts when I have heard them.”
     </p>
<p>
      He raised his eyes to mine, and I was astonished to observe a strange
      eagerness in their depths; evidently his convictions were stronger than
      his scruples. “Mr. Raymond,” he began, “you are a lawyer, and undoubtedly
      a practical man; but you may know what it is to scent danger before you
      see it, to feel influences working in the air over and about you, and yet
      be in ignorance of what it is that affects you so powerfully, till chance
      reveals that an enemy has been at your side, or a friend passed your
      window, or the shadow of death crossed your book as you read, or mingled
      with your breath as you slept?”
     </p>
<p>
      I shook my head, fascinated by the intensity of his gaze into some sort of
      response.
    </p>
<p>
      “Then you cannot understand me, or what I have suffered these last three
      weeks.” And he drew back with an icy reserve that seemed to promise but
      little to my now thoroughly awakened curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
      “I beg your pardon,” I hastened to say; “but the fact of my never having
      experienced such sensations does not hinder me from comprehending the
      emotions of others more affected by spiritual influences than myself.”
     </p>
<p>
      He drew himself slowly forward. “Then you will not ridicule me if I say
      that upon the eve of Mr. Leavenworth’s murder I experienced in a dream all
      that afterwards occurred; saw him murdered, saw”—and he clasped his
      hands before him, in an attitude inexpressibly convincing, while his voice
      sank to a horrified whisper, “saw the face of his murderer!”
     </p>
<p>
      I started, looked at him in amazement, a thrill as at a ghostly presence
      running through me.
    </p>
<p>
      “And was that——” I began.
    </p>
<p>
      “My reason for denouncing the man I beheld before me in the hall of Miss
      Leavenworth’s house last night? It was.” And, taking out his handkerchief,
      he wiped his forehead, on which the perspiration was standing in large
      drops.
    </p>
<p>
      “You would then intimate that the face you saw in your dream and the face
      you saw in the hall last night were the same?”
     </p>
<p>
      He gravely nodded his head.
    </p>
<p>
      I drew my chair nearer to his. “Tell me your dream,” said I.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was the night before Mr. Leavenworth’s murder. I had gone to bed
      feeling especially contented with myself and the world at large; for,
      though my life is anything but a happy one,” and he heaved a short sigh,
      “some pleasant words had been said to me that day, and I was revelling in
      the happiness they conferred, when suddenly a chill struck my heart, and
      the darkness which a moment before had appeared to me as the abode of
      peace thrilled to the sound of a supernatural cry, and I heard my name,
      ‘Trueman, Trueman, Trueman,’ repeated three times in a voice I did not
      recognize, and starting from my pillow beheld at my bedside a woman. Her
      face was strange to me,” he solemnly proceeded, “but I can give you each
      and every detail of it, as, bending above me, she stared into my eyes with
      a growing terror that seemed to implore help, though her lips were quiet,
      and only the memory of that cry echoed in my ears.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Describe the face,” I interposed.
    </p>
<p>
      “It was a round, fair, lady’s face. Very lovely in contour, but devoid of
      coloring; not beautiful, but winning from its childlike look of trust. The
      hair, banded upon the low, broad forehead, was brown; the eyes, which were
      very far apart, gray; the mouth, which was its most charming feature,
      delicate of make and very expressive. There was a dimple in the chin, but
      none in the cheeks. It was a face to be remembered.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Go on,” said I.
    </p>
<p>
      “Meeting the gaze of those imploring eyes, I started up. Instantly the
      face and all vanished, and I became conscious, as we sometimes do in
      dreams, of a certain movement in the hall below, and the next instant the
      gliding figure of a man of imposing size entered the library. I remember
      experiencing a certain thrill at this, half terror, half curiosity, though
      I seemed to know, as if by intuition, what he was going to do. Strange to
      say, I now seemed to change my personality, and to be no longer a third
      party watching these proceedings, but Mr. Leavenworth himself, sitting at
      his library table and feeling his doom crawling upon him without capacity
      for speech or power of movement to avert it. Though my back was towards
      the man, I could feel his stealthy form traverse the passage, enter the
      room beyond, pass to that stand where the pistol was, try the drawer, find
      it locked, turn the key, procure the pistol, weigh it in an accustomed
      hand, and advance again. I could feel each footstep he took as though his
      feet were in truth upon my heart, and I remember staring at the table
      before me as if I expected every moment to see it run with my own blood. I
      can see now how the letters I had been writing danced upon the paper
      before me, appearing to my eyes to take the phantom shapes of persons and
      things long ago forgotten; crowding my last moments with regrets and dead
      shames, wild longings, and unspeakable agonies, through all of which that
      face, the face of my former dream, mingled, pale, sweet, and searching,
      while closer and closer behind me crept that noiseless foot till I could
      feel the glaring of the assassin’s eyes across the narrow threshold
      separating me from death and hear the click of his teeth as he set his
      lips for the final act. Ah!” and the secretary’s livid face showed the
      touch of awful horror, “what words can describe such an experience as
      that? In one moment, all the agonies of hell in the heart and brain, the
      next a blank through which I seemed to see afar, and as if suddenly
      removed from all this, a crouching figure looking at its work with
      starting eyes and pallid back-drawn lips; and seeing, recognize no face
      that I had ever known, but one so handsome, so remarkable, so unique in
      its formation and character, that it would be as easy for me to mistake
      the countenance of my father as the look and figure of the man revealed to
      me in my dream.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And this face?” said I, in a voice I failed to recognize as my own.
    </p>
<p>
      “Was that of him whom we saw leave Mary Leavenworth’s presence last night
      and go down the hall to the front door.”
