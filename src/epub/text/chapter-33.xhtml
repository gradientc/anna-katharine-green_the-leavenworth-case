      XXXIII. UNEXPECTED TESTIMONY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    <i>Pol.</i> What do you read, my lord?
    <i>Ham.</i> Words, words, words.
        —Hamlet.
</pre>
<p>
      MRS. BELDEN paused, lost in the sombre shadow which these words were
      calculated to evoke, and a short silence fell upon the room. It was broken
      by my asking for some account of the occurrence she had just mentioned, it
      being considered a mystery how Hannah could have found entrance into her
      house without the knowledge of the neighbors.
    </p>
<p>
      “Well,” said she, “it was a chilly night, and I had gone to bed early (I
      was sleeping then in the room off this) when, at about a quarter to one—the
      last train goes through R—— at 12.50—there came a low
      knock on the window-pane at the head of my bed. Thinking that some of the
      neighbors were sick, I hurriedly rose on my elbow and asked who was there.
      The answer came in low, muffled tones, ‘Hannah, Miss Leavenworth’s girl!
      Please let me in at the kitchen door.’ Startled at hearing the well-known
      voice, and fearing I knew not what, I caught up a lamp and hurried round
      to the door. ‘Is any one with you?’ I asked. ‘No,’ she replied. ‘Then come
      in.’ But no sooner had she done so than my strength failed me, and I had
      to sit down, for I saw she looked very pale and strange, was without
      baggage, and altogether had the appearance of some wandering spirit.
      ‘Hannah!’ I gasped, ‘what is it? what has happened? what brings you here
      in this condition and at this time of night?’ ‘Miss Leavenworth has sent
      me,’ she replied, in the low, monotonous tone of one repeating a lesson by
      rote. ‘She told me to come here; said you would keep me. I am not to go
      out of the house, and no one is to know I am here.’ ‘But why?’ I asked,
      trembling with a thousand undefined fears; ‘what has occurred?’ ‘I dare
      not say,’ she whispered; ‘I am forbid; I am just to stay here, and keep
      quiet.’ ‘But,’ I began, helping her to take off her shawl,—the dingy
      blanket advertised for in the papers—‘you must tell me. She surely
      did not forbid you to tell <i>me?</i>’ ‘Yes she did; every one,’ the girl
      replied, growing white in her persistence, ‘and I never break my word;
      fire couldn’t draw it out of me.’ She looked so determined, so utterly
      unlike herself, as I remembered her in the meek, unobtrusive days of our
      old acquaintance, that I could do nothing but stare at her. ‘You will keep
      me,’ she said; ‘you will not turn me away?’ ‘No,’ I said, ‘I will not turn
      you away.’ ‘And tell no one?’ she went on. ‘And tell no one,’ I repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      “This seemed to relieve her. Thanking me, she quietly followed me
      up-stairs. I put her into the room in which you found her, because it was
      the most secret one in the house; and there she has remained ever since,
      satisfied and contented, as far as I could see, till this very same
      horrible day.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And is that all?” I asked. “Did you have no explanation with her
      afterwards? Did she never give you any information in regard to the
      transactions which led to her flight?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, sir. She kept a most persistent silence. Neither then nor when, upon
      the next day, I confronted her with the papers in my hand, and the awful
      question upon my lips as to whether her flight had been occasioned by the
      murder which had taken place in Mr. Leavenworth’s household, did she do
      more than acknowledge she had run away on this account. Some one or
      something had sealed her lips, and, as she said, ‘Fire and torture should
      never make her speak.’”
     </p>
<p>
      Another short pause followed this; then, with my mind still hovering about
      the one point of intensest interest to me, I said:
    </p>
<p>
      “This story, then, this account which you have just given me of Mary
      Leavenworth’s secret marriage and the great strait it put her into—a
      strait from which nothing but her uncle’s death could relieve her—together
      with this acknowledgment of Hannah’s that she had left home and taken
      refuge here on the insistence of Mary Leavenworth, is the groundwork you
      have for the suspicions you have mentioned?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, sir; that and the proof of her interest in the matter which is given
      by the letter I received from her yesterday, and which you say you have
      now in your possession.”
     </p>
<p>
      Oh, that letter!
    </p>
<p>
      “I know,” Mrs. Belden went on in a broken voice, “that it is wrong, in a
      serious case like this, to draw hasty conclusions; but, oh, sir, how can I
      help it, knowing what I do?”
     </p>
<p>
      I did not answer; I was revolving in my mind the old question: was it
      possible, in face of all these later developments, still to believe Mary
      Leavenworth’s own hand guiltless of her uncle’s blood?
    </p>
<p>
      “It is dreadful to come to such conclusions,” proceeded Mrs. Belden, “and
      nothing but her own words written in her own hand would ever have driven
      me to them, but——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Pardon me,” I interrupted; “but you said in the beginning of this
      interview that you did not believe Mary herself had any direct hand in her
      uncle’s murder. Are you ready to repeat that assertion?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, yes, indeed. Whatever I may think of her influence in inducing it, I
      never could imagine her as having anything to do with its actual
      performance. Oh, no! oh, no! whatever was done on that dreadful night,
      Mary Leavenworth never put hand to pistol or ball, or even stood by while
      they were used; that you may be sure of. Only the man who loved her,
      longed for her, and felt the impossibility of obtaining her by any other
      means, could have found nerve for an act so horrible.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Then you think——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Clavering is the man? I do: and oh, sir, when you consider that he is
      her husband, is it not dreadful enough?”
     </p>
<p>
      “It is, indeed,” said I, rising to conceal how much I was affected by this
      conclusion of hers.
    </p>
<p>
      Something in my tone or appearance seemed to startle her. “I hope and
      trust I have not been indiscreet,” she cried, eying me with something like
      an incipient distrust. “With this dead girl lying in my house, I ought to
      be very careful, I know, but——”
     </p>
<p>
      “You have said nothing,” was my earnest assurance as I edged towards the
      door in my anxiety to escape, if but for a moment, from an atmosphere that
      was stifling me. “No one can blame you for anything you have either said
      or done to-day. But”—and here I paused and walked hurriedly back,—“I
      wish to ask one question more. Have you any reason, beyond that of natural
      repugnance to believing a young and beautiful woman guilty of a great
      crime, for saying what you have of Henry Clavering, a gentleman who has
      hitherto been mentioned by you with respect?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No,” she whispered, with a touch of her old agitation.
    </p>
<p>
      I felt the reason insufficient, and turned away with something of the same
      sense of suffocation with which I had heard that the missing key had been
      found in Eleanore Leavenworth’s possession. “You must excuse me,” I said;
      “I want to be a moment by myself, in order to ponder over the facts which
      I have just heard; I will soon return “; and without further ceremony,
      hurried from the room.
    </p>
<p>
      By some indefinable impulse, I went immediately up-stairs, and took my
      stand at the western window of the large room directly over Mrs. Belden.
      The blinds were closed; the room was shrouded in funereal gloom, but its
      sombreness and horror were for the moment unfelt; I was engaged in a
      fearful debate with myself. Was Mary Leavenworth the principal, or merely
      the accessory, in this crime? Did the determined prejudice of Mr. Gryce,
      the convictions of Eleanore, the circumstantial evidence even of such
      facts as had come to our knowledge, preclude the possibility that Mrs.
      Belden’s conclusions were correct? That all the detectives interested in
      the affair would regard the question as settled, I did not doubt; but need
      it be? Was it utterly impossible to find evidence yet that Henry Clavering
      was, after all, the assassin of Mr. Leavenworth?
    </p>
<p>
      Filled with the thought, I looked across the room to the closet where lay
      the body of the girl who, according to all probability, had known the
      truth of the matter, and a great longing seized me. Oh, why could not the
      dead be made to speak? Why should she lie there so silent, so pulseless,
      so inert, when a word from her were enough to decide the awful question?
      Was there no power to compel those pallid lips to move?
    </p>
<p>
      Carried away by the fervor of the moment, I made my way to her side. Ah,
      God, how still! With what a mockery the closed lips and lids confronted my
      demanding gaze! A stone could not have been more unresponsive.
    </p>
<p>
      With a feeling that was almost like anger, I stood there, when—what
      was it I saw protruding from beneath her shoulders where they crushed
      against the bed? An envelope? a letter? Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Dizzy with the sudden surprise, overcome with the wild hopes this
      discovery awakened, I stooped in great agitation and drew the letter out.
      It was sealed but not directed. Breaking it hastily open, I took a glance
      at its contents. Good heavens! it was the work of the girl herself!—its
      very appearance was enough to make that evident! Feeling as if a miracle
      had happened, I hastened with it into the other room, and set myself to
      decipher the awkward scrawl.
    </p>
<p>
      This is what I saw, rudely printed in lead pencil on the inside of a sheet
      of common writing-paper:
    </p>
<p>
      “I am a wicked girl. I have knone things all the time which I had ought to
      have told but I didn’t dare to he said he would kill me if I did I mene
      the tall splendud looking gentulman with the black mustash who I met
      coming out of Mister Levenworth’s room with a key in his hand the night
      Mr. Levenworth was murdered. He was so scared he gave me money and made me
      go away and come here and keep every thing secret but I can’t do so no
      longer. I seem to see Miss Elenor all the time crying and asking me if I
      want her sent to prisun. God knows I’d rathur die. And this is the truth
      and my last words and I pray every body’s forgivness and hope nobody will
      blame me and that they wont bother Miss Elenor any more but go and look
      after the handsome gentulman with the black mushtash.”
