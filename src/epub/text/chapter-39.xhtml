      XXXIX. THE OUTCOME OF A GREAT CRIME
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    “Leave her to Heaven
    And to those thorns that
    In her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her.”
         —Hamlet

    “For she is wise, if I can judge of her;
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true;
    And true she is, as she has proved herself;
    And therefore like herself, wise, fair, and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul.”
         —Merchant of Venice.
</pre>
<p>
      “OH, ELEANORE!” I cried, as I made my way into her presence, “are you
      prepared for very good news? News that will brighten these pale cheeks and
      give the light back to these eyes, and make life hopeful and sweet to you
      once more? Tell me,” I urged, stooping over her where she sat, for she
      looked ready to faint.
    </p>
<p>
      “I don’t know,” she faltered; “I fear your idea of good news and mine may
      differ. No news can be good but——”
     </p>
<p>
      “What?” I asked, taking her hands in mine with a smile that ought to have
      reassured her, it was one of such profound happiness. “Tell me; do not be
      afraid.”
     </p>
<p>
      But she was. Her dreadful burden had lain upon her so long it had become a
      part of her being. How could she realize it was founded on a mistake; that
      she had no cause to fear the past, present, or future?
    </p>
<p>
      But when the truth was made known to her; when, with all the fervor and
      gentle tact of which I was capable, I showed her that her suspicions had
      been groundless, and that Trueman Harwell, and not Mary, was accountable
      for the evidences of crime which had led her into attributing to her
      cousin the guilt of her uncle’s death, her first words were a prayer to be
      taken to the one she had so wronged. “Take me to her! Oh, take me to her!
      I cannot breathe or think till I have begged pardon of her on my knees.
      Oh, my unjust accusation! My unjust accusation!”
     </p>
<p>
      Seeing the state she was in, I deemed it wise to humor her. So, procuring
      a carriage, I drove with her to her cousin’s home.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mary will spurn me; she will not even look at me; and she will be right!”
       she cried, as we rolled away up the avenue. “An outrage like this can
      never be forgiven. But God knows I thought myself justified in my
      suspicions. If you knew—”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do know,” I interposed. “Mary acknowledges that the circumstantial
      evidence against her was so overwhelming, she was almost staggered
      herself, asking if she could be guiltless with such proofs against her.
      But——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wait, oh, wait; did Mary say that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes.”
     </p>
<p>
      “To-day?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mary must be changed.”
     </p>
<p>
      I did not answer; I wanted her to see for herself the extent of that
      change. But when, in a few minutes later, the carriage stopped and I
      hurried with her into the house which had been the scene of so much
      misery, I was hardly prepared for the difference in her own countenance
      which the hall light revealed. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks were
      brilliant, her brow lifted and free from shadow; so quickly does the ice
      of despair melt in the sunshine of hope.
    </p>
<p>
      Thomas, who had opened the door, was sombrely glad to see his mistress
      again. “Miss Leavenworth is in the drawing-room,” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      I nodded, then seeing that Eleanore could scarcely move for agitation,
      asked her whether she would go in at once, or wait till she was more
      composed.
    </p>
<p>
      “I will go in at once; I cannot wait.” And slipping from my grasp, she
      crossed the hall and laid her hand upon the drawing-room curtain, when it
      was suddenly lifted from within and Mary stepped out.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mary!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Eleanore!”
     </p>
<p>
      The ring of those voices told everything. I did not need to glance their
      way to know that Eleanore had fallen at her cousin’s feet, and that her
      cousin had affrightedly lifted her. I did not need to hear: “My sin
      against you is too great; you cannot forgive me!” followed by the low: “My
      shame is great enough to lead me to forgive anything!” to know that the
      lifelong shadow between these two had dissolved like a cloud, and that,
      for the future, bright days of mutual confidence and sympathy were in
      store.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet when, a half-hour or so later, I heard the door of the reception room,
      into which I had retired, softly open, and looking up, saw Mary standing
      on the threshold, with the light of true humility on her face, I own that
      I was surprised at the softening which had taken place in her haughty
      beauty. “Blessed is the shame that purifies,” I inwardly murmured, and
      advancing, held out my hand with a respect and sympathy I never thought to
      feel for her again.
    </p>
<p>
      The action seemed to touch her. Blushing deeply, she came and stood by my
      side. “I thank you,” said she. “I have much to be grateful for; how much I
      never realized till to-night; but I cannot speak of it now. What I wish is
      for you to come in and help me persuade Eleanore to accept this fortune
      from my hands. It is hers, you know; was willed to her, or would have been
      if—”
     </p>
<p>
      “Wait,” said I, in the trepidation which this appeal to me on such a
      subject somehow awakened. “Have you weighed this matter well? Is it your
      determined purpose to transfer your fortune into your cousin’s hands?”
     </p>
<p>
      Her look was enough without the low, “Ah, how can you ask me?” that
      followed it.
    </p>
<p>
      Mr. Clavering was sitting by the side of Eleanore when we entered the
      drawing-room. He immediately rose, and drawing me to one side, earnestly
      said:
    </p>
<p>
      “Before the courtesies of the hour pass between us, Mr. Raymond, allow me
      to tender you my apology. You have in your possession a document which
      ought never to have been forced upon you. Founded upon a mistake, the act
      was an insult which I bitterly regret. If, in consideration of my mental
      misery at that time, you can pardon it, I shall feel forever indebted to
      you; if not——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Clavering, say no more. The occurrences of that day belong to a past
      which I, for one, have made up my mind to forget as soon as possible. The
      future promises too richly for us to dwell on bygone miseries.”
     </p>
<p>
      And with a look of mutual understanding and friendship we hastened to
      rejoin the ladies.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the conversation that followed, it is only necessary to state the
      result. Eleanore, remaining firm in her refusal to accept property so
      stained by guilt, it was finally agreed upon that it should be devoted to
      the erection and sustainment of some charitable institution of magnitude
      sufficient to be a recognized benefit to the city and its unfortunate
      poor. This settled, our thoughts returned to our friends, especially to
      Mr. Veeley.
    </p>
<p>
      “He ought to know,” said Mary. “He has grieved like a father over us.”
       And, in her spirit of penitence, she would have undertaken the unhappy
      task of telling him the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      But Eleanore, with her accustomed generosity, would not hear of this. “No,
      Mary,” said she; “you have suffered enough. Mr. Raymond and I will go.”
     </p>
<p>
      And leaving them there, with the light of growing hope and confidence on
      their faces, we went out again into the night, and so into a dream from
      which I have never waked, though the shine of her dear eyes have been now
      the load-star of my life for many happy, happy months.
