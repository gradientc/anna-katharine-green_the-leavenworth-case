      VII. MARY LEAVENWORTH
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    “For this relief much thanks.”
         Hamlet.
</pre>
<p>
      HAVE you ever observed the effect of the sunlight bursting suddenly upon
      the earth from behind a mass of heavily surcharged clouds? If so, you can
      have some idea of the sensation produced in that room by the entrance of
      these two beautiful ladies. Possessed of a loveliness which would have
      been conspicuous in all places and under all circumstances, Mary, at
      least, if not her less striking, though by no means less interesting
      cousin, could never have entered any assemblage without drawing to herself
      the wondering attention of all present. But, heralded as here, by the most
      fearful of tragedies, what could you expect from a collection of men such
      as I have already described, but overmastering wonder and incredulous
      admiration? Nothing, perhaps, and yet at the first murmuring sound of
      amazement and satisfaction, I felt my soul recoil in disgust.
    </p>
<p>
      Making haste to seat my now trembling companion in the most retired spot I
      could find, I looked around for her cousin. But Eleanore Leavenworth, weak
      as she had appeared in the interview above, showed at this moment neither
      hesitation nor embarrassment. Advancing upon the arm of the detective,
      whose suddenly assumed air of persuasion in the presence of the jury was
      anything but reassuring, she stood for an instant gazing calmly upon the
      scene before her. Then bowing to the coroner with a grace and
      condescension which seemed at once to place him on the footing of a
      politely endured intruder in this home of elegance, she took the seat
      which her own servants hastened to procure for her, with an ease and
      dignity that rather recalled the triumphs of the drawing-room than the
      self-consciousness of a scene such as that in which we found ourselves.
      Palpable acting, though this was, it was not without its effect. Instantly
      the murmurs ceased, the obtrusive glances fell, and something like a
      forced respect made itself visible upon the countenances of all present.
      Even I, impressed as I had been by her very different demeanor in the room
      above, experienced a sensation of relief; and was more than startled when,
      upon turning to the lady at my side, I beheld her eyes riveted upon her
      cousin with an inquiry in their depths that was anything but encouraging.
      Fearful of the effect this look might have upon those about us, I hastily
      seized her hand which, clenched and unconscious, hung over the edge of her
      chair, and was about to beseech her to have care, when her name, called in
      a slow, impressive way by the coroner, roused her from her abstraction.
      Hurriedly withdrawing her gaze from her cousin, she lifted her face to the
      jury, and I saw a gleam pass over it which brought back my early fancy of
      the pythoness. But it passed, and it was with an expression of great
      modesty she settled herself to respond to the demand of the coroner and
      answer the first few opening inquiries.
    </p>
<p>
      But what can express the anxiety of that moment to me? Gentle as she now
      appeared, she was capable of great wrath, as I knew. Was she going to
      reiterate her suspicions here? Did she hate as well as mistrust her
      cousin? Would she dare assert in this presence, and before the world, what
      she found it so easy to utter in the privacy of her own room and the
      hearing of the one person concerned? Did she wish to? Her own countenance
      gave me no clue to her intentions, and, in my anxiety, I turned once more
      to look at Eleanore. But she, in a dread and apprehension I could easily
      understand, had recoiled at the first intimation that her cousin was to
      speak, and now sat with her face covered from sight, by hands blanched to
      an almost deathly whiteness.
    </p>
<p>
      The testimony of Mary Leavenworth was short. After some few questions,
      mostly referring to her position in the house and her connection with its
      deceased master, she was asked to relate what she knew of the murder
      itself, and of its discovery by her cousin and the servants.
    </p>
<p>
      Lifting up a brow that seemed never to have known till now the shadow of
      care or trouble, and a voice that, whilst low and womanly, rang like a
      bell through the room, she replied:
    </p>
<p>
      “You ask me, gentlemen, a question which I cannot answer of my own
      personal knowledge. I know nothing of this murder, nor of its discovery,
      save what has come to me through the lips of others.”
     </p>
<p>
      My heart gave a bound of relief, and I saw Eleanore Leavenworth’s hands
      drop from her brow like stone, while a flickering gleam as of hope fled
      over her face, and then died away like sunlight leaving marble.
    </p>
<p>
      “For, strange as it may seem to you,” Mary earnestly continued, the shadow
      of a past horror revisiting her countenance, “I did not enter the room
      where my uncle lay. I did not even think of doing so; my only impulse was
      to fly from what was so horrible and heartrending. But Eleanore went in,
      and she can tell you——”
     </p>
<p>
      “We will question Miss Eleanore Leavenworth later,” interrupted the
      coroner, but very gently for him. Evidently the grace and elegance of this
      beautiful woman were making their impression. “What we want to know is
      what <i>you</i> saw. You say you cannot tell us of anything that passed in
      the room at the time of the discovery?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Only what occurred in the hall?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Nothing occurred in the hall,” she innocently remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      “Did not the servants pass in from the hall, and your cousin come out
      there after her revival from her fainting fit?”
     </p>
<p>
      Mary Leavenworth’s violet eyes opened wonderingly.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, sir; but that was nothing.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You remember, however, her coming into the hall?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, sir.”
     </p>
<p>
      “With a paper in her hand?”
     </p>
<p>
      “Paper?” and she wheeled suddenly and looked at her cousin. “Did you have
      a paper, Eleanore?”
     </p>
<p>
      The moment was intense. Eleanore Leavenworth, who at the first mention of
      the word paper had started perceptibly, rose to her feet at this naive
      appeal, and opening her lips, seemed about to speak, when the coroner,
      with a strict sense of what was regular, lifted his hand with decision,
      and said:
    </p>
<p>
      “You need not ask your cousin, Miss; but let us hear what you have to say
      yourself.”
     </p>
<p>
      Immediately, Eleanore Leavenworth sank back, a pink spot breaking out on
      either cheek; while a slight murmur testified to the disappointment of
      those in the room, who were more anxious to have their curiosity gratified
      than the forms of law adhered to.
    </p>
<p>
      Satisfied with having done his duty, and disposed to be easy with so
      charming a witness, the coroner repeated his question. “Tell us, if you
      please, if you saw any such thing in her hand?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I? Oh, no, no; I saw nothing.”
     </p>
<p>
      Being now questioned in relation to the events of the previous night, she
      had no new light to throw upon the subject. She acknowledged her uncle to
      have been a little reserved at dinner, but no more so than at previous
      times when annoyed by some business anxiety.
    </p>
<p>
      Asked if she had seen her uncle again that evening, she said no, that she
      had been detained in her room. That the sight of him, sitting in his seat
      at the head of the table, was the very last remembrance she had of him.
    </p>
<p>
      There was something so touching, so forlorn, and yet so unobtrusive, in
      this simple recollection of hers, that a look of sympathy passed slowly
      around the room.
    </p>
<p>
      I even detected Mr. Gryce softening towards the inkstand. But Eleanore
      Leavenworth sat unmoved.
    </p>
<p>
      “Was your uncle on ill terms with any one?” was now asked. “Had he
      valuable papers or secret sums of money in his possession?”
     </p>
<p>
      To all these inquiries she returned an equal negative.
    </p>
<p>
      “Has your uncle met any stranger lately, or received any important letter
      during the last few weeks, which might seem in any way to throw light upon
      this mystery?”
     </p>
<p>
      There was the slightest perceptible hesitation in her voice, as she
      replied: “No, not to my knowledge; I don’t know of any such.” But here,
      stealing a side glance at Eleanore, she evidently saw something that
      reassured her, for she hastened to add:
    </p>
<p>
      “I believe I may go further than that, and meet your question with a
      positive no. My uncle was in the habit of confiding in me, and I should
      have known if anything of importance to him had occurred.”
     </p>
<p>
      Questioned in regard to Hannah, she gave that person the best of
      characters; knew of nothing which could have led either to her strange
      disappearance, or to her connection with crime. Could not say whether she
      kept any company, or had any visitors; only knew that no one with any such
      pretensions came to the house. Finally, when asked when she had last seen
      the pistol which Mr. Leavenworth always kept in his stand drawer, she
      returned, not since the day he bought it; Eleanore, and not herself,
      having the charge of her uncle’s apartments.
    </p>
<p>
      It was the only thing she had said which, even to a mind freighted like
      mine, would seem to point to any private doubt or secret suspicion; and
      this, uttered in the careless manner in which it was, would have passed
      without comment if Eleanore herself had not directed at that moment a very
      much aroused and inquiring look upon the speaker.
    </p>
<p>
      But it was time for the inquisitive juror to make himself heard again.
      Edging to the brink of the chair, he drew in his breath, with a vague awe
      of Mary’s beauty, almost ludicrous to see, and asked if she had properly
      considered what she had just said.
    </p>
<p>
      “I hope, sir, I consider all I am called upon to say at such a time as
      this,” was her earnest reply.
    </p>
<p>
      The little juror drew back, and I looked to see her examination terminate,
      when suddenly his ponderous colleague of the watch-chain, catching the
      young lady’s eye, inquired:
    </p>
<p>
      “Miss Leavenworth, did your uncle ever make a will?”
     </p>
<p>
      Instantly every man in the room was in arms, and even she could not
      prevent the slow blush of injured pride from springing to her cheek. But
      her answer was given firmly, and without any show of resentment.
    </p>
<p>
      “Yes, sir,” she returned simply.
    </p>
<p>
      “More than one?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I never heard of but one.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Are you acquainted with the contents of that will?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I am. He made no secret of his intentions to any one.”
     </p>
<p>
      The juryman lifted his eye-glass and looked at her. Her grace was little
      to him, or her beauty or her elegance. “Perhaps, then, you can tell me who
      is the one most likely to be benefited by his death?”
     </p>
<p>
      The brutality of this question was too marked to pass unchallenged. Not a
      man in that room, myself included, but frowned with sudden disapprobation.
      But Mary Leavenworth, drawing herself up, looked her interlocutor calmly
      in the face, and restrained herself to say:
    </p>
<p>
      “I know who would be the greatest losers by it. The children he took to
      his bosom in their helplessness and sorrow; the young girls he enshrined
      with the halo of his love and protection, when love and protection were
      what their immaturity most demanded; the women who looked to him for
      guidance when childhood and youth were passed—these, sir, these are
      the ones to whom his death is a loss, in comparison to which all others
      which may hereafter befall them must ever seem trivial and unimportant.”
     </p>
<p>
      It was a noble reply to the basest of insinuations, and the juryman drew
      back rebuked; but here another of them, one who had not spoken before, but
      whose appearance was not only superior to the rest, but also almost
      imposing in its gravity, leaned from his seat and in a solemn voice said:
    </p>
<p>
      “Miss Leavenworth, the human mind cannot help forming impressions. Now
      have you, with or without reason, felt at any time conscious of a
      suspicion pointing towards any one person as the murderer of your uncle?”
     </p>
<p>
      It was a frightful moment. To me and to one other, I am sure it was not
      only frightful, but agonizing. Would her courage fail? would her
      determination to shield her cousin remain firm in the face of duty and at
      the call of probity? I dared not hope it.
    </p>
<p>
      But Mary Leavenworth, rising to her feet, looked judge and jury calmly in
      the face, and, without raising her voice, giving it an indescribably clear
      and sharp intonation, replied:
    </p>
<p>
      “No; I have neither suspicion nor reason for any. The assassin of my uncle
      is not only entirely unknown to, but completely unsuspected by, me.”
     </p>
<p>
      It was like the removal of a stifling pressure. Amid a universal outgoing
      of the breath, Mary Leavenworth stood aside and Eleanore was called in her
      place.
