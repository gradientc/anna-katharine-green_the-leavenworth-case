      XXIV. A REPORT FOLLOWED BY SMOKE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    “Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where Hope is coldest, and Despair most sits.”
         —All’s Well that Ends Well.
</pre>
<p>
      WHEN I told Mr. Gryce I only waited for the determination of one fact, to
      feel justified in throwing the case unreservedly into his hands, I alluded
      to the proving or disproving of the supposition that Henry Clavering had
      been a guest at the same watering-place with Eleanore Leavenworth the
      summer before.
    </p>
<p>
      When, therefore, I found myself the next morning with the Visitor Book of
      the Hotel Union at R—— in my hands, it was only by the
      strongest effort of will I could restrain my impatience. The suspense,
      however, was short. Almost immediately I encountered his name, written not
      half a page below those of Mr. Leavenworth and his nieces, and, whatever
      may have been my emotion at finding my suspicions thus confirmed, I
      recognized the fact that I was in the possession of a clue which would yet
      lead to the solving of the fearful problem which had been imposed upon me.
    </p>
<p>
      Hastening to the telegraph office, I sent a message for the man promised
      me by Mr. Gryce, and receiving for an answer that he could not be with me
      before three o’clock, started for the house of Mr. Monell, a client of
      ours, living in R——. I found him at home and, during our
      interview of two hours, suffered the ordeal of appearing at ease and
      interested in what he had to say, while my heart was heavy with its first
      disappointment and my brain on fire with the excitement of the work then
      on my hands.
    </p>
<p>
      I arrived at the depot just as the train came in.
    </p>
<p>
      There was but one passenger for R——, a brisk young man, whose
      whole appearance differed so from the description which had been given me
      of Q that I at once made up my mind he could not be the man I was looking
      for, and was turning away disappointed, when he approached, and handed me
      a card on which was inscribed the single character “?” Even then I could
      not bring myself to believe that the slyest and most successful agent in
      Mr. Gryce’s employ was before me, till, catching his eye, I saw such a
      keen, enjoyable twinkle sparkling in its depths that all doubt fled, and,
      returning his bow with a show of satisfaction, I remarked:
    </p>
<p>
      “You are very punctual. I like that.”
     </p>
<p>
      He gave another short, quick nod. “Glad, sir, to please you. Punctuality
      is too cheap a virtue not to be practised by a man on the lookout for a
      rise. But what orders, sir? Down train due in ten minutes; no time to
      spare.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Down train? What have we to do with that?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I thought you might wish to take it, sir. Mr. Brown”—winking
      expressively at the name, “always checks his carpet-bag for home when he
      sees me coming. But that is your affair; I am not particular.”
     </p>
<p>
      “I wish to do what is wisest under the circumstances.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Go home, then, as speedily as possible.” And he gave a third sharp nod
      exceedingly business-like and determined.
    </p>
<p>
      “If I leave you, it is with the understanding that you bring your
      information first to me; that you are in my employ, and in that of no one
      else for the time being; and that <i>mum</i> is the word till I give you
      liberty to speak.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes, sir. When I work for Brown &amp; Co. I do not work for Smith &amp;
      Jones. That you can count on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Very well then, here are your instructions.”
     </p>
<p>
      He looked at the paper I handed him with a certain degree of care, then
      stepped into the waiting-room and threw it into the stove, saying in a low
      tone: “So much in case I should meet with some accident: have an
      apoplectic fit, or anything of that sort.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Oh, don’t worry; I sha’n’t forget. I’ve a memory, sir. No need of anybody
      using pen and paper with me.”
     </p>
<p>
      And laughing in the short, quick way one would expect from a person of his
      appearance and conversation, he added: “You will probably hear from me in
      a day or so,” and bowing, took his brisk, free way down the street just as
      the train came rushing in from the West.
    </p>
<p>
      My instructions to Q were as follows:
    </p>
<p>
      1. To find out on what day, and in whose company, the Misses Leavenworth
      arrived at R—— the year before. What their movements had been
      while there, and in whose society they were oftenest to be seen. Also the
      date of their departure, and such facts as could be gathered in regard to
      their habits, etc.
    </p>
<p>
      2. Ditto in respect to a Mr. Henry Clavering, fellow-guest and probable
      friend of said ladies.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Name of individual fulfilling the following requirements: Clergyman,
      Methodist, deceased since last December or thereabouts, who in July of
      Seventy-five was located in some town not over twenty miles from R——.
    </p>
<p>
      4. Also name and present whereabouts of a man at that time in service of
      the above.
    </p>
<p>
      To say that the interval of time necessary to a proper inquiry into these
      matters was passed by me in any reasonable frame of mind, would be to give
      myself credit for an equanimity of temper which I unfortunately do not
      possess. Never have days seemed so long as the two which interposed
      between my return from R—— and the receipt of the following
      letter:
    </p>
<p>
      “Sir:
    </p>
<p>
      “Individuals mentioned arrived in R—— July 3, 1875. Party
      consisted of four; the two ladies, their uncle, and the girl named Hannah.
      Uncle remained three days, and then left for a short tour through
      Massachusetts. Gone two weeks, during which ladies were seen more or less
      with the gentleman named between us, but not to an extent sufficient to
      excite gossip or occasion remark, when said gentleman left R——
      abruptly, two days after uncle’s return. Date July 19. As to habits of
      ladies, more or less social. They were always to be seen at picnics,
      rides, etc., and in the ballroom. M—— liked best. E——considered
      grave, and, towards the last of her stay, moody. It is remembered now that
      her manner was always peculiar, and that she was more or less shunned by
      her cousin.
    </p>
<p>
      However, in the opinion of one girl still to be found at the hotel, she
      was the sweetest lady that ever breathed. No particular reason for this
      opinion. Uncle, ladies, and servants left R—— for New York,
      August 7, 1875.
    </p>
<p>
      “2. H. C. arrived at the hotel in R——July 6, 1875, in-company
      with Mr. and Mrs. Vandervort, friends of the above. Left July 19, two
      weeks from day of arrival. Little to be learned in regard to him.
      Remembered as the handsome gentleman who was in the party with the L.
      girls, and that is all.
    </p>
<p>
      “3. F——, a small town, some sixteen or seventeen miles from R——,
      had for its Methodist minister, in July of last year, a man who has since
      died, Samuel Stebbins by name. Date of decease, Jan. 7 of this year.
    </p>
<p>
      “4. Name of man in employ of S. S. at that time is Timothy Cook. He has
      been absent, but returned to F—— two days ago. Can be seen if
      required.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah, ha!” I cried aloud at this point, in my sudden surprise and
      satisfaction; “now we have something to work upon!” And sitting down I
      penned the following reply:
    </p>
<p>
      “T. C. wanted by all means. Also any evidence going to prove that H. C.
      and E. L. were married at the house of Mr. S. on any day of July or August
      last.”
     </p>
<p>
      Next morning came the following telegram:
    </p>
<p>
      “T. C. on the road. Remembers a marriage. Will be with you by 2 p.m.”
     </p>
<p>
      At three o’clock of that same day, I stood before Mr. Gryce. “I am here to
      make my report,” I announced.
    </p>
<p>
      The flicker of a smile passed over his face, and he gazed for the first
      time at his bound-up finger-ends with a softening aspect which must have
      done them good. “I’m ready,” said he.
    </p>
<p>
      “Mr. Gryce,” I began, “do you remember the conclusion we came to at our
      first interview in this house?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I remember the <i>one you</i> came to.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Well, well,” I acknowledged a little peevishly, “the one I came to, then.
      It was this: that if we could find to whom Eleanore Leavenworth felt she
      owed her best duty and love, we should discover the man who murdered her
      uncle.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And do you imagine you have done this?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do.”
     </p>
<p>
      His eyes stole a little nearer my face. “Well! that is good; go on.”
     </p>
<p>
      “When I undertook this business of clearing Eleanore Leavenworth from
      suspicion,” I resumed, “it was with the premonition that this person would
      prove to be her lover; but I had no idea he would prove to be her
      husband.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Gryce’s gaze flashed like lightning to the ceiling.
    </p>
<p>
      “What!” he ejaculated with a frown.
    </p>
<p>
      “The lover of Eleanore Leavenworth is likewise her husband,” I repeated.
      “Mr. Clavering holds no lesser connection to her than that.”
     </p>
<p>
      “How have you found that out?” demanded Mr. Gryce, in a harsh tone that
      argued disappointment or displeasure.
    </p>
<p>
      “That I will not take time to state. The question is not how I became
      acquainted with a certain thing, but is what I assert in regard to it
      true. If you will cast your eye over this summary of events gleaned by me
      from the lives of these two persons, I think you will agree with me that
      it is.” And I held up before his eyes the following:
    </p>
<p>
      “During the two weeks commencing July 6, of the year 1875, and ending July
      19, of the same year, Henry R. Clavering, of London, and Eleanore
      Leavenworth, of New York, were guests of the same hotel. <i> Fact proved
      by Visitor Book of the Hotel Union at R</i>——, <i>New York.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “They were not only guests of the same hotel, but are known to have held
      more or less communication with each other. <i>Fact proved by such
      servants now employed in R—— as were in the hotel at that
      time.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “July 19. Mr. Clavering left R—— abruptly, a circumstance that
      would not be considered remarkable if Mr. Leavenworth, whose violent
      antipathy to Englishmen as husbands is publicly known, had not just
      returned from a journey.
    </p>
<p>
      “July 30. Mr. Clavering was seen in the parlor of Mr. Stebbins, the
      Methodist minister at F——, a town about sixteen miles from R——,
      where he was married to a lady of great beauty. <i>Proved by Timothy Cook,
      a man in the employ of Mr. Stebbins, who was called in from the garden to
      witness the ceremony and sign a paper supposed to be a certificate.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “July 31. Mr. Clavering takes steamer for Liverpool. <i>Proved by
      newspapers of that date.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “September. Eleanore Leavenworth in her uncle’s house in New York,
      conducting herself as usual, but pale of face and preoccupied in manner.
      <i>Proved by servants then in her service.</i> Mr. Clavering in London;
      watches the United States mails with eagerness, but receives no letters.
      Fits up room elegantly, as for a lady. <i>Proved by secret communication
      from London.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “November. Miss Leavenworth still in uncle’s house. No publication of her
      marriage ever made. Mr. Clavering in London; shows signs of uneasiness;
      the room prepared for lady closed. <i>Proved as above.</i>
</p>
<p>
      “January 17, 1876. Mr. Clavering, having returned to America, engages room
      at Hoffman House, New York.
    </p>
<p>
      “March 1 or 2. Mr. Leavenworth receives a letter signed by Henry
      Clavering, in which he complains of having been ill-used by one of that
      gentleman’s nieces. A manifest shade falls over the family at this time.
    </p>
<p>
      “March 4. Mr. Clavering under a false name inquires at the door of Mr.
      Leavenworth’s house for Miss Eleanore Leavenworth. <i>Proved by Thomas.’”</i>
</p>
<p>
      “March 4th?” exclaimed Mr. Gryce at this point. “That was the night of the
      murder.-”
     </p>
<p>
      “Yes; the Mr. Le Roy Robbins said to have called that evening was none
      other than Mr. Clavering.”
     </p>
<p>
      “March 19. Miss Mary Leavenworth, in a conversation with me, acknowledges
      that there is a secret in the family, and is just upon the point of
      revealing its nature, when Mr. Clavering enters the house. Upon his
      departure she declares her unwillingness ever to mention the subject
      again.”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Gryce slowly waved the paper aside. “And from these facts you draw the
      inference that Eleanore Leavenworth is the wife of Mr. Clavering?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I do.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And that, being his wife——”
     </p>
<p>
      “It would be natural for her to conceal anything she knew likely to
      criminate him.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Always supposing Clavering himself had done anything criminal!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Of course.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Which latter supposition you now propose to justify!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Which latter supposition it is left for <i>us</i> to justify.”
     </p>
<p>
      A peculiar gleam shot over Mr. Gryce’s somewhat abstracted countenance.
      “Then you have no new evidence against Mr. Clavering?”
     </p>
<p>
      “I should think the fact just given, of his standing in the relation of
      unacknowledged husband to the suspected party was something.”
     </p>
<p>
      “No positive evidence as to his being the assassin of Mr. Leavenworth, I
      mean?”
     </p>
<p>
      I was obliged to admit I had none which he would consider positive. “But I
      can show the existence of motive; and I can likewise show it was not only
      possible, but probable, he was in the house at the time of the murder.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Ah, you can!” cried Mr. Gryce, rousing a little from his abstraction.
    </p>
<p>
      “The motive was the usual one of self-interest. Mr. Leavenworth stood in
      the way of Eleanore’s acknowledging him as a husband, and he must
      therefore be put out of the way.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Weak!”
     </p>
<p>
      “Motives for murders are sometimes weak.”
     </p>
<p>
      “The motive for this was not. Too much calculation was shown for the arm
      to have been nerved by anything short of the most deliberate intention,
      founded upon the deadliest necessity of passion or avarice.”
     </p>
<p>
      “Avarice?”
     </p>
<p>
      “One should never deliberate upon the causes which have led to the
      destruction of a rich man without taking into account that most common
      passion of the human race.”
     </p>
<p>
      “But——”
     </p>
<p>
      “Let us hear what you have to say of Mr. Clavering’s presence in the house
      at the time of the murder.”
     </p>
<p>
      I related what Thomas the butler had told me in regard to Mr. Clavering’s
      call upon Miss Leavenworth that night, and the lack of proof which existed
      as to his having left the house when supposed to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      “That is worth remembering,” said Mr. Gryce at the conclusion. “Valueless
      as direct evidence, it might prove of great value as corroborative.” Then,
      in a graver tone, he went on to say: “Mr. Raymond, are you aware that in
      all this you have been strengthening the case against Eleanore Leavenworth
      instead of weakening it?”
     </p>
<p>
      I could only ejaculate, in my sudden wonder and dismay.
    </p>
<p>
      “You have shown her to be secret, sly, and unprincipled; capable of
      wronging those to whom she was most bound, her uncle and her husband.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You put it very strongly,” said I, conscious of a shocking discrepancy
      between this description of Eleanore’s character and all that I had
      preconceived in regard to it.
    </p>
<p>
      “No more so than your own conclusions from this story warrant me in
      doing.” Then, as I sat silent, murmured low, and as if to himself: “If the
      case was dark against her before, it is doubly so with this supposition
      established of her being the woman secretly married to Mr. Clavering.”
     </p>
<p>
      “And yet,” I protested, unable to give up my hope without a struggle; “you
      do not, cannot, believe the noble-looking Eleanore guilty of this horrible
      crime?”
     </p>
<p>
      “No,” he slowly said; “you might as well know right here what I think
      about that. I believe Eleanore Leavenworth to be an innocent woman.”
     </p>
<p>
      “You do? Then what,” I cried, swaying between joy at this admission and
      doubt as to the meaning of his former expressions, “remains to be done?”
     </p>
<p>
      Mr. Gryce quietly responded: “Why, nothing but to prove your supposition a
      false one.”
